\title{Maintain Azure Authentication Tokens}
\usage{
maintain_azure_tokens(max_age_days = 6, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{max_age_days}{Maximum age in days before a token is considered stale
and should be removed. Default is 6 days (one day before the typical
7-day conditional access policy limit).}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, prints informational messages about token maintenance.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with counts of tokens removed and refreshed.
}
\description{
Proactively manages Azure/Microsoft 365 authentication tokens to prevent
authentication errors. Removes tokens older than \code{max_age_days} (which would
fail to refresh due to conditional access policies) and refreshes tokens
that are still valid to extend their lifetime.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Manually run token maintenance
maintain_azure_tokens()

# Check status without making changes
maintain_azure_tokens(verbose = TRUE)
}
